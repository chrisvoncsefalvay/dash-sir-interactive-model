## Empirical values

Based on studies (see References), good approximations of the key
determinants are as follows.

* $R_0$: Estimates of $R_0$ range from 1.4 to 6.49. Studies that relied on statistical estimation range from 2.20 to 3.58, with a median value of 2.6 (Liu et al. 2020).
* $\\tau$: A good estimate for $\\tau$ is given by Pan (2020), for a median duration of illness of $8.5 \pm 3.9$ days.
